        <h3>Questions</h3>
        <p>1. Name a situation where you would need to create an "if" statement.</p>
        <p>2. When comparing values, in what data type is the result stored?</p><br>
        <h3>Answers</h3>
        <p>1. A situation where an "if" statement would be useful is checking to see if a username is taken or not.</p>
        <p>2. The result is stored and returned as a boolean datatype.</p>

            // Asks customer to confirm shopping total they entered
            confirm("$" + total + " total? Click OK to continue!");
